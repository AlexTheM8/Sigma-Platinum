# Summary
Sigma Platinum is a mod for **Pokémon Brilliant Diamond & Shining Pearl** that is designed around **Pokémon Platinum**. It also includes additional elements to enhance the experience in the style of a traditional GAME FREAK remake, such as **Pokémon HeartGold & SoulSilver**, or **Pokémon Omega Ruby & Alpha Sapphire**.

It is *not* a 1:1 remake of **Platinum**, as some of the issues from that game have been fixed or improved.
